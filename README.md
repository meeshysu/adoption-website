# Adoption Website

This website was a fantastic project to help us learn MODULES! Of course, that was not the only thing that we dove into. This project contains a JSON file where we put our array of pets within. This taught us how to write proper JSON content and attach it back to the JavaScript file in an empty and private variable. There is also a function with event listeners to display whether or not the page actually loaded correctly. If not, you'll get a pleasant statement saying that it is broken - tying back to the functions that are related to them, one with the obscure 'this'.
